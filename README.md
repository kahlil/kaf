# K A F

A small app built with Web Components and [lit-html](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/lit-html).

## Development

First install the deps with `npm install`, then start the dev server with `npm start.

This only works in Chrome and Safari for now. I am currently not using any polyfills.

## Status

Work in progress.
